# BitComplementTable

### Task
In a given table _A_ of binary values, how many rows can be altered to contain only _1's_ or only _0's_ 
by replacing the values of any fixed combination of columns with their complements?

### Example

_A_:  


| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**0**| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
|**1**| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|**2**| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
|**3**| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
|**4**| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
 
_Result = 4_

If columns 2 and 3 are replaced by their complements, rows 0 and 4 contain only _1_'s and rows 1 and 3 contain only _0_'s.
